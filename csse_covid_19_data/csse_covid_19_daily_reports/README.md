* one entry per day. The date for each entry is in TDatime format.
* data are structured in std::vectors, all of the same size. One element per Province/Country.
* for each (Province, Country) couple, the following numbers are available:
  * Cases: total confirmed cases since the start
  * Deaths
  * Recovered
  * DeltaCases, DeltaDeaths, DeltaRecovered: defined as Cases(day N) - Cases(day N-1). Note: these numbers are not always reliable, especially as the (Province, Country) division can change from one day to the other.
